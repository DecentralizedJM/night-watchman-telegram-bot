# Night Watchman 🌙🤖

**AI-Powered Telegram Superbot** — 24/7 intelligent watchdog with hybrid AI/ML spam detection. Protects your groups from spam, scams, recruitment fraud, and more using advanced Deep Learning + Ensemble ML classifiers.

**Latest Release:** v1.4.0 (January 13, 2026) - 🧠 Adaptive Scam Detection
- **NEW:** Generic pattern detection - catches ANY casino variant (42casino, 77casino, 88casino, etc.)
- **NEW:** /newscam command - teach bot about new scams in natural language
- **NEW:** Hugging Face zero-shot AI - detects completely novel scams
- **NEW:** Auto-retraining ML - learns immediately from admin feedback
- **NEW:** Four-tier detection architecture (Regex → ML → Gemini → HF)
- **NEW:** Pattern extraction engine - extracts keywords from scam descriptions using AI

## 🧠 Adaptive Scam Detection

Night Watchman now features a **truly adaptive** four-tier AI/ML detection system that learns from new threats and catches novel variations automatically.

### Detection Architecture

![Detection Architecture](docs/detection_architecture.png)

**How It Works:**

1. **Layer 1: Generic Regex** - Fast pattern matching catches known variants (42casino, 77casino, lucky2026, etc.)
2. **Layer 2: ML Classifier** - Ensemble model trained on spam examples (TF-IDF + 3 classifiers)
3. **Layer 3: Gemini AI** - Intelligent contextual analysis for subtle patterns
4. **Layer 4: Hugging Face** - Zero-shot classification for completely novel scams

### 🎓 Teaching the Bot - `/newscam` Command

Admins can now teach the bot about new scams in plain English:

```
Admin: /newscam They're promoting 88casino with code mega2026 for $1000 bonus

Bot: ✅ Learned new scam pattern!
     📝 Category: casino
     🔑 Keywords extracted: 88casino, mega2026, $1000, bonus
     🎯 Patterns: 2 regex patterns extracted
     🤖 ML Model: Retrained with this example
     💡 The bot will now detect similar scams automatically!
```

**What happens:**
- Gemini AI extracts keywords and patterns from your description
- Bot adds example to ML training data
- ML model retrains **immediately** (5-10 seconds)
- Bot automatically detects similar scams going forward

### 🎯 Generic Pattern Detection

The bot now catches **ANY variant** automatically:

| Pattern Type | Examples Detected |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Casino variants** | 42casino, 77casino, 88casino, 99casino, casino42, newcasino77 |
| **Promo codes** | lucky2026, lucky2027, win2025, mega2024, promo2026 |
| **Reward scams** | "Congratulations! $100 received", "Won $250 instantly" |
| **Signup spam** | "Sign up here: https://88casino.com" |

**Before:** Only caught specific patterns like "52casino"  
**Now:** Catches ANY number+casino combination automatically!
